In school, Lisa's popularity's affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. Lisa Simpson's a smart, witty, independent girl who focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at age 8 she's already a member of MENSA with an IQ of 159."

                    Ralph Wiggum is a student who attends Springfield Elementary School. He is best known as the town's resident oddball, and has been immortalized for his non sequiturs and erratic behavior. His lines range from purely nonsensical, or bizarre interpretations of a current event, to surprisingly profound statements that go over people's heads. For this, Ralph is somewhat of an outcast among his peers, although he seems to be on good terms with a fair number of the other kids at school such as Bart, Lisa, and Milhouse.

                    The son of Police Chief Clancy and Sarah Wiggum, Ralph is rarely picked on or bullied due to his unscrupulous father's position. He purportedly has immense potential as a musical performer (school roles attained for him, however, by his police chief father's extorting Springfield teachers, including Miss Hoover, which may explain her dislike for Ralph). He also manipulated the Republican and Democratic parties in Springfield to join forces in their support of him for public office in "E Pluribus Wiggum", a parody of voting and elections.
